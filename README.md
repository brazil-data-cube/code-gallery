# SBSR 2023 BDC Course

The course "Earth Observation Data Cubes and Image Time Series Analysis" aims to present an introduction to concepts of Earth observation data cubes and time series analysis of remote sensing images using data and services from the Brazil Data project Cube, from INPE. The course was taught using the R language on April 2, 2023 with the following schedule:
